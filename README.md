<p align='center'><samp>I have recently graduated from Texas Christian University with a Bachelor degree of Computer Science and Mathematics. I am currently working as a Software Development Intern at Hyosung America and actively looking for a full-time opportunity. I love <strong>Web Development</strong> (frontend, mostly!) and have done a good number of projects. During my internship at Hyosung, I have found myself interested in <strong>Data Science</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong> as well.</samp>
