## Hey, you found me! üòç

I have recently graduated from Texas Christian University with a Bachelor degree of Computer Science and Mathematics. I am currently working as a Software Development Intern at Hyosung America and actively looking for a full-time opportunity. I love **Web Development** (frontend, mostly!) and have done a good number of projects. During my internship at Hyosung, I have found myself interested in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** as well.
